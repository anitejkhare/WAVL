# WAVL
This project implements the Weak AVL(WAVL) tree data structure. This tree is special because it has characteristics of both AVL Trees and RB Trees. Every AVL tree is a WAVL tree and every WAVL tree can be coloured as a red-black tree. By relaxing the definition of height and introducing the concept of integer ranks in its place, it is overall more efficient than both RB and AVL trees. 
The code uploaded implements WAVL as a sorted map and is capable of handling insert/delete/update functionalities. Its performance was benchmarked against a standard HashMap as part of a course project.
